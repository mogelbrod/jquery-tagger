Tagger: jQuery plugin

A jQuery plugin which turns form text inputs into tag inputs, enabling easy entry and removal of tag-like strings. Can optionally be coupled with the Suggester plugin (included), which enables a suggestion list and completion of strings when provided with a list of suggestions.
